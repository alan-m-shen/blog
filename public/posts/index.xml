      <description>&lt;p&gt;The personalized nature of our online experiences, driven by algorithms on social media and news platforms, often leads to a phenomenon where individuals primarily encounter content that aligns with their existing interests and beliefs. This is commonly referred to as a &amp;ldquo;filter bubble.&amp;rdquo; This curated information environment is increasingly a subject of academic and legal scrutiny, both in Canada and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The personalized nature of our online experiences, driven by algorithms on social media and news platforms, often leads to a phenomenon where individuals primarily encounter content that aligns with their existing interests and beliefs. This is commonly referred to as a &amp;ldquo;filter bubble.&amp;rdquo; This curated information environment is increasingly a subject of academic and legal scrutiny, both in Canada and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their core, the algorithms powering these platforms aim to maximize user engagement by learning from online behaviours—such as clicks, likes, and shares—to deliver more of what appears to resonate with the individual. While this tailored content delivery can enhance user experience, it also presents a significant challenge: the creation of an insular information space. When individuals are predominantly exposed to content that reinforces their pre-existing perspectives, their exposure to diverse viewpoints diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
